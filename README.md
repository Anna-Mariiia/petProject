This repository contains a simple automated test created as part of my application for the QA Engineer position at your company. The test shows how I use Cypress to write automation scripts for web applications.

Although the test is short, it highlights my focus on making tests efficient and easy to maintain. I’ve used the Page Object Model (POM) to manage selectors, which makes the code cleaner and easier to update. I also use fixture files for test data, so I don’t hard-code values directly in the test scripts. 
Thank you for your time!
